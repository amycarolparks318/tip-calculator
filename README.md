## Welcome! 👋

Thanks for checking out this front-end coding challenge.

[Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io) challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects.

**To do this challenge, you need a basic understanding of HTML, CSS and JavaScript.**

## The challenge (and requirements)

Your challenge is to build out this tip calculator app and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

Use the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript skills you've learned so far to build out this tip calculator app.

Your users should be able to:
- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Calculate the correct tip and total cost of the bill per person

Add validation for the input fields. Bill must be a positive number. Number-of-people must be a number greater than zero. Look at the active-states image in the design folder for an example.

Make sure your app is responsive and looks good on mobile and desktop sizes.

## Where to find everything

Your task is to build out the project to the designs inside the `/design` folder. You will find both a mobile and a desktop version of the design. 

The designs are in JPG static format. Using JPGs will mean that you'll need to use your best judgment for styles such as `font-size`, `padding` and `margin`. 

You will find all the required assets in the `/images` folder. The assets are already optimized.

There is also a `style-guide.md` file containing the information you'll need, such as color palette and fonts.

**Have fun building!** 🚀
